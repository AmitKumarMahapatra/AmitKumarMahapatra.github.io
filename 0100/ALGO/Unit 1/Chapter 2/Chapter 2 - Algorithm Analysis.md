## Algorithm Analysis

If a problem is having more than 1 algorithm, the best algorithm is
decided by analysis based on 2 factors.

1.  Time Complexity (CPU Time that the algorithm requires)
2.  Space Complexity (Main Memory space required by the algorithm)

### Time Complexity Analysis

APostiary Analysis                  APriori Analysis
It is postponing, instead of giving It will not be postponed. It will
the actual answer                   give the result quite instantly
It depends on the language of       It is independent on the language
Compiler and type of Processor      of compiler and Type of processor
Hence called Relative analysis      Hence called Absolute Analysis
Gives Exact Answer                  Gives Approximate Answer
Answer is different from system to  Same answer in every system

#### Motivational Quote
Everyone can not buy a supercomputer, but everyone can write a super
algorithm.

#### Motivational Quote
In the CSE Field, if you know the algorithm, somehow you will survive. That is for sure.

### APriori Analysis Examples

#### Example 1

##### Case A

##### Case B

##### Case C

##### Case D

##### Case E

#### Example 2

##### Case A


##### Case B


##### Case C


#### Exam Tricks

Few things are just to confuse you. Not really affect the final output
at all.

##### Case D

##### Case E

##### Case F

##### Case G

##### Case H

##### Case I

#### Example 3

##### Case A

##### Case B

##### Case C

##### Case D

##### Case E

#### Exam Tricks

Exam is not for learning purposes. So don't waste time in doing proofs.

##### Case F

##### Case G

#### Example 4

##### Case A

##### Case B

#### Example 5

#### Exam Tricks
If you are having trouble finding the TC from FOR Loop, convert into WHILE Loop.

#### Example 6

#### Example 7

#### Example 8

#### Example 9 (Tricky One)

#### Motivational Quote

$(0.99){}^{365}\  = \ 0.02\ $

$(1){}^{365}\  = \ 1\ $

$(0.99){}^{365}\  = \ 37.78$ 

#### Example 10 (Tricky One)

#### Motivational Quote
Don\'t be like a problem person, Be a solution Person.

#### Example 11

##### Note for Example 11
-   Except Example 11, in all other previous examples, the T(n) has
    always one particular answer. That is, T(n) does not depend on the
    **Type of n**. But in Example 11, the algorithm gives **different**
    T(n) depending upon the value of **Type of n**.
-   Here, we need to understand the use of $\odot$, $\Omega$ and
    $\Theta$.
-   $\odot$, $\Omega$ and $\Theta$ is not used for Worst Case, Best case
    and Average case.
-   $\odot$, $\Omega$ and $\Theta$ is not only used for Time and Space
    Complexity. They are used whenever we don\'t have an actual answer,
    and we can only give an approximate one.
-   $\odot$ simply means the right side is greater or equal.
-   $\Omega$ simply means the left side is greater or equal.
-   Where we can write both $\odot$ and $\Omega$ in there we can write
    $\Theta$.
-   This will be explained in Chapter 3.

#### Motivational Quote

Don't cry if anything new comes in. Just Smile and learn it.

#### Example 12

#### Example 13

#### Example 14

##### Case A

#### Exam Tricks
-   Going forward, if any **DECREASING GP SERIES** comes in, just take
    it as constant and proceed. No need to calculate,
-   Time complexity means loops only. In the exam they will give a big
    program with no recursion and loops, and will ask for time
    complexity. This kind of trick they might use.

##### Case B
